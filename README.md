# Hello, I'm Ivaylo! ðŸ‘‹  
  
I'm a self taught full-stack developer in TÃ¼rkiye, not a very good country but that's not gonna stop me! I mostly code in my free time with `JavaScript`.   
I mostly understand how codes work but if I'm not comfortable with the language I'm writing on then things get slow.  
  
## Quick Info âœ¨  
- My pronouns are He/Him  
- My birthday is in 5 months 6 days
- I know `Python`, `JavaScript`, `Golang`, `HTML` and `CSS`!  
  
## How to reach me? ðŸ’¬  
  
- Discord: `@iv.aylo`  
- Email: `randomacc.for1randomthings@gmail.com`  
  
## Projects ðŸ”¥  
  
I'm not in many projects but I try to make the ones I'm in good!  
  
- ðŸ†˜ `BDFD-Tutorials` - The basics and hard parts of BDFD, awesome for everyone!  
  
- ðŸ‘¾ `Unofficial BDFD api` - BDFD users are in struggle with the limits they have, so this is a helpful API for them   
  
If you have any ideas of improvement, contact me!
